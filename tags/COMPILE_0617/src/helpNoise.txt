Adds noise to movie, which might enhance perceptual quality

Old noise algorithm - random noise pattern generated every second frame
New noise algorithm - one noise pattern displayed on different places on every frame

Uniform noise - when checked noise strength doesn't depend on original brightness, otherwise less noise is added to dark areas
