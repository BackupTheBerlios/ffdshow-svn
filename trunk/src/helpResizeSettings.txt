Resizing can be applied before or after other filters. This is controled with "Resizing is applied before other filters" checkbox.
Resize algorithms:
  Fast bilinear - fast with acceptable quality
  Bilinear - quality slighty better than previous, but a little bit slower
  Bicubic - high quality, slower
  Experimental - similar to bicubic, but with different coefficients
  Point - fastest, ugliest
  Area - 
Gaussian blur - during resizing, image can be slightly blurred - independend on blur filter
Sharpen - sharpens image during resizing, independend on sharpening filters
