Resize algorithms:
  Fast bilinear - fast with acceptable quality
  Bilinear - quality slighty better than previous, but a little bit slower
  Bicubic - high quality, slower
  Experimental - similar to bicubic, but with different coefficients
  Point - fastest, ugliest
  Area - 
  None - just adds black borders or crops the image
Gaussian blur - during resizing, image can be slightly blurred - independend on blur filter
Sharpen - sharpens image during resizing, independend on sharpening filters
